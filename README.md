# Advanced_CSS_Portfolio
A portfolio to showcase the projects being worked on during this bootcamp


The portfolio utilizes flexbox and seperates each section into its own subcontainer that holds a header, as well as the associated content.

Using media queries, the layout will later change so that the header is above the content instead. 

As we proceed further into the class, I'll be able to add more class projects onto here, for now, there are placeholder images, that link into an empty file.
